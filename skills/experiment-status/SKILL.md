# /experiment-status

Check the current status of your autonomous experiment agent.

## Usage

```
/experiment-status
/experiment-status --project /path/to/project
```

## Behavior

1. Read `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` — show the research goal
2. Read `MEMORY_LOG.md` — show key results and recent decisions  
3. Read `.cycle_counter` — show how many cycles completed
4. Check for running training processes (via PID files or `pgrep`)
5. If training is running, `tail` the log file for latest output
6. Show GPU utilization for the project's GPUs
7. Check if `HUMAN_DIRECTIVE.md` exists (pending directive)

## Output Format

```markdown
# Experiment Status — my-project

## Goal
Train ViT-B/16 on ImageNet to 78%+ accuracy

## Progress
- Cycles completed: 4
- Current best: 78.3% (Exp004, ViT-B/16 + cosine + mixup)
- Status: TRAINING (PID 12345, GPU 0, running 3.2h)

## Latest Training Log
Epoch 45/90 | loss: 2.134 | acc: 77.1% | lr: 1.2e-4

## Recent Decisions
1. [04-08 14:45] Target reached with mixup, trying stronger augmentation
2. [04-08 06:00] Cosine schedule helped, adding regularization

## Pending Directive
None (drop a file at workspace/HUMAN_DIRECTIVE.md to intervene)
