# /daily-papers

Search arXiv for the latest papers relevant to the user's research interests.

## Behavior

1. Ask the user for topics if not provided (or use defaults from config)
2. Search arXiv for papers published in the last 1-3 days
3. Check against previously recommended papers (dedup)
4. Rank by relevance to the user's research
5. For top 5: provide detailed analysis (motivation, method, key results, insights)
6. For next 5: provide brief summaries
7. Save recommendations to a dated markdown file

## Deduplication

Maintain a list of previously recommended paper IDs. Never recommend the same paper twice.

## Output Format

```markdown
