---

# /paper-analyze

Perform deep analysis of a single academic paper.

## Usage

```
/paper-analyze <arxiv_id or url>
```

## Behavior

1. Fetch paper metadata from arXiv API
2. Attempt to download arXiv source package (.tar.gz)
3. Extract actual figures from source (not screenshots)
4. Read the full paper (PDF if source unavailable)
5. Generate structured analysis

## Figure Extraction

Priority order:
1. arXiv source package → extract .png/.jpg/.pdf figures
2. PDF extraction as fallback
3. Name files with arxiv_id prefix to avoid collisions

## Output Format

```markdown
# [Paper Title]

**arXiv**: [id] | **Authors**: ... | **Year**: ...

## Problem
What specific problem does this paper address?

## Motivation  
Why is this problem important? What gap exists?

## Method
